* documents

+ run to completion: 
   : {'exit_status': 'success', 
   :  'num_events': {'baseline': 2, 'primary': 3}}

+ stopped: baseline=1, primary < expected: 
   : {'exit_status': 'success', 
   :  'num_events': {'baseline': 1, 'primary': 2}}
  expected is ~...['start']['plan_args']['num']~

+ aborted: baseline=1, primary < expected: 
   : {'exit_status': aborted', 
   :  'num_events': {'baseline': 1, 'primary': 2}}
  expected is ~...['start']['plan_args']['num']~


* BMM_kafka key in start document

+ hint
+ pngout
+ other filenames
+ break up hint into discrete keys?

* plots for various scan types

** line scans [2/6]

*** DONE generic line scan

 + plot signal vs. motor position
 + can find motor in start document
 + need hinting to determine signal to be plotted

*** DONE rectangle scan                                             :threads:

 + plot fit to data
 + can find motor in start document
 + need hinting to determine signal to be analyzed and plotted

*** TODO peak scan

*** TODO rocking_curve

 always plotting dcm_pitch vs. I0
 so just need hinting about being a rocking curve scan

*** TODO slit_height

 always plotting dm3_bct vs. I0
 so just need hinting about being a slit height scan

*** TODO glancing angle alignment                                   :threads:

 These plots are done by passing info about the fit results. Probably
 need to simply redo the fit (or find the peak or com) in the consumer.

 + recognize beginning of ga alignment
 + 1st y vs It scan
   + plot fit
 + pitch vs It scan
   + close first plot
   + plot data with marker
 + 2nd y vs It scan
   + close second plot
   + plot fit
   + push UID to list
 + 2nd pitch ve It scan
   + close third plot
   + plot data with marker
   + push UID to list
 + y vs If scan
   + close fourth plot
   + push UID of y vs If plot to list
   + make triplot


*** find_slot                                                       :threads:

 + show fit to first direction
 + show fit to second direction
 + need hinting about being a find_slot scan
 + need hinting about detector

Might need to send distinctive hint to kafka to disambiguate find_slot
from a rectangle scan.


** DONE time scans

 SEAD scan needs a plot made at end and saved to a file

** TODO area scans [1/4]

*** DONE areascan plot

*** TODO everything needed for raster dossier

 + picture
 + matlab and xlsx files

*** TODO difference 

 needs a list of 2 UIDs to build maps and compute
 difference, display and save to file 

*** TODO valence map 

 needs a list of 3 UIDs, properly tagged with energy
 compute differences, display, save to files

** TODO XAFS scans

 hoo boy....

 needs to recognize end of a scan sequence, produce triplot


 Pandrosus will need self.folder=BMMuser.folder & self.db=bmm_catalog 

 make merge of scans so far, set title to "title_of_first, merge of N scans"

 make triplot

* Dossiers

This is a good way to test whether a dossier can be made entirely from
the content of the start document and to start fixing the start
document to fill in any gaps
